export const what = 'Penspinning is a skillful manipulation of a pen or pencil, often performed with one hand, where the pen is spun and rotated around the fingers in various intricate patterns. It is a form of contact juggling and is often practiced as a form of personal amusement or as a display of dexterity and coordination. Penspinning has gained popularity as a hobby and a form of performance art, with enthusiasts often sharing videos of their skills online or participating in competitions and communities dedicated to the practice.';
export const history = 'The origins of pen spinning date back to pre-WWII Japan, with basic tricks like the ThumbAround and Sonic being performed as early as the 1970s. Hideaki Kondoh, credited as a pioneer, launched the first pen spinning website in Japan in 1997, showcasing 24 tricks he had compiled and developed. In the United States, Fernando Kuo, also known as "Kam," was inspired by Kondoh\'s work and founded Pentrix in 2000, aiming to create a hub for pen spinning enthusiasts. As the community grew, forums like the Universal Pen Spinning Board emerged to facilitate global communication among enthusiasts. The repertoire of tricks expanded significantly, with newer ones like the Shadow, Palm Spin, and Bust emerging. The rise of video-sharing platforms like YouTube since the early 2000s has further popularized pen spinning, culminating in events like the World Tournament in 2007, the first global competition for pen spinners.';
export const fingerSlots = 'Penspinners use a numbering system called finger slots to represent hand positions while spinning pens. Fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, with the thumb represented by "T". Slots are denoted by combining these numbers, such as "12" for the space between index and middle fingers. Additional symbols represent other hand parts, like "TF" for thumb flap and "P" for palm. The "*" symbol indicates the absence of a supporting body part or object. Various slot systems exist for describing complex positions, but are typically used only when needed to avoid confusion.';
